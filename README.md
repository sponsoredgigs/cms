# üìÑ SponsoredGigs Content Management System (CMS)

Welcome to SponsoredGigs CMS! This is an integral part of the SponsoredGigs ecosystem, designed specifically to manage jobs, posts, and the admin panel user data with ease.

Built on the robust Payload framework, this CMS offers a feature-rich platform for content management, complete with a RESTful API for interacting with different data collections, a GraphQL API for advanced querying, and even a webhook setup for seamless content updates.

For more technical details of Payload, check out the [official documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs).

## üí° How to Use
### Interacting with the REST API

| `/api/jobs` | GET | Fetch a list of jobs | No |
| `/api/jobs/{documentId}` | GET | Retrieve a specific job entry | No |

### Querying the GraphQL API
Our CMS also provides a GraphQL API. To learn more about this, run the development build on your local machine and navigate to `/api/graphql`. You can also try the playground at `/api/graphql-playground`.

### Webhook
The CMS will trigger a new static site generation for [SponsoredGigs.com](https://www.sponsoredgigs.com) whenever there's any content update.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started with Development
Here is how to start the CMS on your local machine with auto-reload enabled, then build and serve the CMS:

```sh
# Copy the example environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Start a development server with auto-reload
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop

# Build and serve CMS (auto-reload disabled)
npm run build && npm run serve
# or
yarn build && yarn serve
```

Schema migration and plugins installation can only be done on the development server.

## üöÄ Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)
Each push to the `main` branch triggers the [publish workflow](.github/workflows/publish-ghcr.yaml), which builds and pushes a Docker image to a private registry. The CMS server then picks up this new build and updates itself with the latest image version.
